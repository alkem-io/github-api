# github-api
The command line interface for interacting with the Alkemio repository on Github.


## Usage

General instructions are available [from Github](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql).

Generate a personal access token using [Github Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

Create a `.env` file from the provided `.env.default` file, and place your personal access token there.

## Notes
The generation process is actually failing to complete, an issue with the tidying up of the generated code. However when it hangs just kill the process and the code is working ok.
